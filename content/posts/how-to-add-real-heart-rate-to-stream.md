Nowadays social video platforms become a very popular way to communicate with people and share your interests. There are millions of broadcasters who want to be unique and to attract more people to watch their LIVE videos. In our opinion, there are two great ways to do your stream better for viewers: create quality content and make your broadcast more interactive. Of course, if you want to become popular you need to develop in both ways. And to help streamers add some interactions to their LIVE videos we created Pulsoid.

Pulsoid is a service, which allows you to add a heart rate widget to live video on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Live, Mixer or any other video platform. Pulsoid is totally free and easy to use. You have an ability to change widget appearance so it will fit your stream better. Font, color, transparency and ECG animation can be changed in a Configuration section.

## What do I need to start using Pulsoid?

Our service works with Bluetooth LE heart rate monitors so you will need a phone with Bluetooth Low Energy support. (You can check it using additional mobile app: iOS or Android).

Also, You will need a heart rate monitor with Bluetooth Low Energy to measure your heart rate.To receive uninterrupted and accurate pulse data heart rate monitor must be with a chest strap. Since there is a wide range of heart rate monitors, we can suggest two monitors, which we tried with our service.

\- CooSpo H6 is one of the cheapest options(about 25$). This monitor works well, is stable enough and has satisfactory quality. Recommended for beginners! Other similar options: Wahoo TICKR

\- Polar H10 costs more(about 65-80$). This one is more stable, accurate and has excellent quality. A great choice if you are going to use it a lot!

\- Watches are NOT supported!

More recommendations you will find in that article.

To make things work you will also need an account on pulsoid.net(to configure a widget and get widget’s URL) and Pulsoid application(for Android or iOS).

_NOTES:_

_If you experience a problem, when Pulsoid application can’t find your monitor, try to find the monitor with BLE scanner app( for Android)._

_Be aware that low battery level of heart rate monitor can cause unstable connection and measurement errors._

_You do not have to pair the monitor before using the app_

_Electrocardiogram monitor might not work well when it and the skin is too dry, that is usually said in monitor instruction._
