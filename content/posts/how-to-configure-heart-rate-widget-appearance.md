Pulsoid Heart Rate Widget for Twitch, Mixer, YouTube Gaming was made for streamers to add their Live Heart Rate Data to Stream.

And we try to make our service not just easy to use but also flexible in widget styling.We understand all importance of matching all parts of stream’s layout in one style. That is why Configuration page has a lot of settings and you can change font, color, setup heart rate zones and choose some animations.

The first feature you might want to try is a Heart Rate Zones. There is a simple way to make things work. Define ‘from-to’ range of your zone, decide if it will be shown or not, for visible range you need to choose a color (it is a color of your bpm number). Repeat it for all zones you need(you can make even only one zone or many of them).

Another changeable attribute is a Font of your bpm number. Paste the name of the font you want to apply.

All fonts from the Google Fonts are supported. You can change the text to numbers in the form above font name and look how your bpm will look like on stream.

Background color can be also customized but will be shown on stream only if you use “Window Capture” instead of “Browser Source”.
